==================================================
FusionLab üî•üß™: Igniting Next-Gen Fusion Models
==================================================

**A Modular Library for Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) Variants & Beyond**

*Extend, experiment, and fuse time-series predictions with
state-of-the-art architectures.*

---

**FusionLab** provides a flexible and extensible framework in
Python for working with advanced time-series forecasting models,
with a special focus on the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) and
its powerful extensions like the Extreme Temporal Fusion
Transformer (XTFT). Whether you're a researcher exploring novel
architectures or a practitioner building robust forecasting
systems, FusionLab offers the tools you need.

---

**Key Features:**
---------------

* üß© **Modular Design:** Build custom TFT variants using reusable,
  well-defined components (attention layers, GRNs, VSNs,
  multi-scale LSTMs, etc.).

* üöÄ **Advanced Architectures:** Includes implementations of standard
  TFT and the high-capacity **XTFT** (Extreme Temporal Fusion X)
  for complex time-series challenges, featuring memory-augmented
  attention, multi-resolution fusion, and more.

* üí° **Extensible:** Easily add new model variants, custom layers,
  or loss functions to experiment with cutting-edge ideas.

* ‚öôÔ∏è **Framework Compatibility:** Designed with compatibility in mind
  for major deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow (current
  focus), PyTorch, and JAX. *(Specify primary framework support)*

* üõ†Ô∏è **Utilities:** Comes with helpful utilities for time-series
  preprocessing, data loading, and evaluation.

* üî¨ **Anomaly Detection:** Integrated anomaly detection capabilities
  within XTFT for identifying and leveraging irregularities in
  data.
