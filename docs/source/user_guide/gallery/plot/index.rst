Plotting & Visualization Gallery
==================================

Welcome to the visualization gallery for ``fusionlab-learn``. A crucial
part of the machine learning workflow is the ability to inspect model
behavior, evaluate performance, and communicate results effectively.
This section provides detailed guides on the various plotting utilities
available in the library.

These tools are built on top of ``matplotlib`` and are designed to
seamlessly integrate with the ``pandas`` DataFrames and ``Keras``
history objects generated by the library's models and utilities.

From diagnosing training runs to creating detailed spatial and temporal
forecast plots, this gallery covers the main functions to help you
understand your models and their predictions.
