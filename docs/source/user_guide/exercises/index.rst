Hands-On Exercises
=====================

Welcome to the exercises section of the ``fusionlab-learn`` user guide.
This collection of hands-on tutorials provides practical, step-by-step
walkthroughs for the library's key features, data preparation
workflows, and model architectures.

Whether you are getting started with basic forecasting or implementing
an advanced, physics-informed model, these guides are designed to help
you master the library's capabilities. We recommend starting with the
**Foundational Skills** if you are new to the library.
